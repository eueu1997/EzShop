# EzShop
Java project developed during Software Engineering course of my Master Degree at Politecnico di Torino.
# Essential description
In order to maintain a stationary shop(cartoleria) a lot of paperwork is needed. People who work in this type of work, want something that can keep track of all that involves the shop.
EZshop is a service that allows a stationery shop to monitor all the activity that is carried out in the shop virtually without using tons of paper and wasting time.
In particular, the application can:

- Store information about employees in the shop and orders to suppliers. Also, the application provides easy access to this information.
- See statistics about the sales of the shop and the orders made to suppliers.
- Register the sales automatically in the system when a purchase is performed.
- Keep track of the amount of products that are present in the shelves of the shop and warehouse.
- Manage a fidelity card system that the customers can use in order to get discounts.

EZshop is supported by a web application (accessible via PC), with different levels of access depending on your role in the shop.
